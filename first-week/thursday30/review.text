/*

    Daily objective: Review and integrate; combine everything
    you've learned into a single script, refactor the mini-projects
    to make them clean and organized.

    This week I understood that functions can be treated as data.

    I learned how to use arrow functions and the importance of keeping the code clean and readable.

    I refactored my mini-projects to make them clearer.

    The hardest part was understanding the behavior of 'this', but now I understand it better.

    Next step: consolidate even more to confidently move into React.
